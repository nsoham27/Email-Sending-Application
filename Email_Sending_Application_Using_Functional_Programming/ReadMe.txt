@Goal: To implement the Email Sending Application


This program is a simple Tkinter-based GUI application for sending emails.
It allows users to log in, register, compose emails with optional attachments, and send them.
The application utilizes the smtplib library for email sending, and the email.mime module for creating MIME messages.
User information is stored and validated during registration and login processes.

Note:
    1. Registration GUI Page just display the information on console.
    2. As checked, Login GUI Page is working properly.
    3. Please open the complete folder(Email_Sending_Application_Using_Functional Programming) on any code editor.
